addEventListener() - Summary
addEventListener() is a method in JavaScript used to attach event handlers to HTML elements. It allows you to specify what happens when a specific event (like a click, mouseover, keydown, etc.) occurs on an element.


- **`getElementById()`**: Use it when selecting an element by its unique `id`. Itâ€™s fast and returns only one element.

- **`querySelector()`**: Use it when you need to select an element with any valid CSS selector (e.g., class, tag, or attribute). It returns the first match and is more flexible.selects the **first** element that matches a given CSS selector.


**querySelectorAll**:
- `querySelectorAll()` selects **all** elements that match a given CSS selector.
- It returns a **NodeList** containing all matching elements.

### **NodeList**:
- A **NodeList** is a collection of DOM elements (like `<div>`, `<p>`, etc.) returned by methods such as `querySelectorAll()`.
- It behaves like an array, but it's not exactly the same.
- You can access elements in a NodeList by index and loop through it.
- It is returned by **querySelectorAll()** and other methods like `childNodes`.
